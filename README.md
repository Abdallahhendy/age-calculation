
## Age Calculation
In this repo, I did a practice on the **datetime** module in Python and simply calculate the age.

I'm correctly handled the negative values, as expected, for example, if today is **15** and the user is born at **20**, the result will be **-5**.

You can use this script in a simple **GUI** or in an **app** to make it easier for people.
